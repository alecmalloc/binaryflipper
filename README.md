A Firefox extension that converts between binary and decimal

This tool is a quick, no-fuss buddy for converting between binary digits and decimals right in your browser. Whether you're diving into some coding, tackling homework, or just messing around with binary, this tool's got you covered. I made this for myself while working on subnetting but thought it might come in handy later on. Feel free to give it a go.

## Getting Started
